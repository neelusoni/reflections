How to use the Git

Version control will help in restoring point in time code

Commit per logical change. If commit interval is too large lots of changes might be lost. For too small interval too manhy versions will be created. 

Some version controls allow multiple files in one commit as they work with code instead of docs.

git log lists the commits in reverse chronological fashion

With ability to go back to previous version it gives confidence for development.

Giving flexibility to write code without fearof breaking the functionality.

git init will initialize the repository
